repmat([1:num_labels], m, 1)
creates row vector of size num_labels and then repeats across m rows

repmat(y, 1, num_labels)
takes a vector of size m and repeats it across num_labels columns

performing == on this effectively replicates the value of y num_labels times for each training example but only gives a 1 when it is a match and a zero otherwise so we get an array of m rows and num_labels columns (andonly one column will have a value per row).

Theta1(:, 2:end) omits the first column of Theta1. (Why are the biases in the first column rather than the first row? Because http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/reshape.html - it has hidden_layer_size rows and (input_layer_size + 1) columns so first column has to be bias.)

Theta1ZeroedBias = [ zeros(size(Theta1, 1), 1) Theta1ExcludingBias ];
Sets the first column to zero.
